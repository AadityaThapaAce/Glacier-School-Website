      <p class="description">
        In 2066 B.S., it was the spirit of idealism that inspired a group of a
        like-minded professional academicians to establish a quality educational
        institution. Thus, was the Glacier International Secondary School born.
        Over the years Glacier has grown in strength to achieve a distinctive
        reputation. Its efforts are aimed at providing a holistic development of
        the studentâ€™s personality which necessarily involves going beyond the
        curriculum. The power of dreams continues to be the driving force of the
        institution.

        Glacier International College, as an institution, a culture, and a
        community, has carved out an impressive position for itself in the field
        of education in Nepal. Glacier International College humbly began its
        journey with a few numbers of students. However weathering the initial
        storm, today it has managed to provide valued education to more than
        1,700 students. It is ably supported by experienced writers, book
        authors, expert academicians and highly motivated teaching faculty.
        Through a determined effort to create an environment that fosters the
        holistic development of its students, Glacier College aims to be a space
        for the celebration of creativity, the rediscovery of tradition, and the
